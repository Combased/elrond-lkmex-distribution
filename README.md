### elrond-lkmex-distribution

**The script for distributing LKMEX to all Your NFTs collection holders üòé!**

Inspired by the [Elrond script utils](https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/script-utils) (we'll unify our scripts in near future).

#### How it works
The script gets the addresses from all collection holders, it excludes **marketplaces** and the owner address/SC address.

Then it distributes your **total** provided LKMEX for all NFTs holders. The more NFTs the wallet address has - the more LKMEX it gets ü§ë.

#### Known limitations & improvements

Right now LKMEX is divided evenly by all addresses. For instance, if the wallet address holds 10 NFTS, he will get **10 transactions** with an equal LKMEX amount.

The gas fee is **cheap** indeed, but it is the most important priority right now to stack the LKMEX and send only a **single transaction per wallet* üßê.

#### Getting started

You need to interact only with the **distribute.sh** file.

To make this distribution work for your NFTs collection you can configure it like this:

##### 1. Configuring Python
You need to have Python installed on your machine or in the virtual environment ü§ì. 

After that run

**pip install -r requirements.txt**

##### 2. Provide the wallet.pem file
You need to generate a wallet.pem file from your secret seed phrase. You can read [here](https://docs.elrond.com/sdk-and-tools/erdpy/deriving-the-wallet-pem-file/) (**read the warning**).

##### 3. Modifying the constants

You need to modify the following constants:

```shell
# Identifier of the collection. Check the collection row https://explorer.elrond.com/collections/COMBEYS-bc640d
NFT_COLLECTION_IDENTIFIER=Your collection identifier
# Null if Smart Contract does not hold NFTs for distribution. Provide an address if it holds.
SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=null
# Found in Elrond Explorer. Check the identifier row and extract the nonce https://explorer.elrond.com/nfts/LKMEX-aab910-22e4ef
LKMEX_NONCE=22e4ef
# The total amount to distribute to the NFTs owners
LKMEX_TOTAL=Your total amount
```
##### 4. Run the script!
Congrats, open the terminal and run **./distribute.sh**. Check the **output** folder for information, which can be displayed in the Discord or your website ü•≥!
